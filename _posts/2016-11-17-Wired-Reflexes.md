title: Wired Reflexes
---

I've been thinking a long time about how to deal with Wired Reflexes (in
Shadowrun) in a PbtA system. To motivate what I'm after, let's look at
this idea of 'wired neural reflexes' manifests in the myriad cyberpunk PbtA systems:

- [[The Sprawl]]()
- [[Sixth World]]()
- [[Running in New Orleans]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/3fhd5r/dw_hack_running_in_new_orleans_patch_7_playable/) 
  At the start of a fight and whenever you Rock’n’Roll, gain hold equal to your
  Wired Reflexes level, until the next time you Rock’n’Roll. You may spend this
  hold immediately to add more damage dice for an attack or to reduce someone
  else’s damage dice for an attack on you or someone within your reach. You may
  also split your damage dice to attack multiple targets.
- [[The Veil]]()

Each of these have one thing in common: they ignore the *fundamental effect* of wired reflexes
in Shadowrun. None of these moves gives a player *extra agency* (which manifests as extra moves
per initiative round in Shadowrun). And, in Shadowrun, that's the fundamental benefit of
boosting initiative: you gain additional opportunities to interact withe the rules and achieve
your goals.

Taking this as our design goal, a wired reflex move should perhaps *grant agency* on a good roll.
For example (where I'll arbitrarily pick Synth as the attribute):

    Wired Reflexes. When you enter a tense situation, where time matters (such
    as combat), roll+Synth. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. You may spend
    your hold 1-for-1 to take an additional action, even interrupting someone
    else's action, over the course of the scene.
    On a miss, hold 1 anyway but be prepared for the worst.

This seems to run into a good 'middle ground' for wired reflexes: you're faster-than-fast, as expected,
and even to the point of interrupting people and pushing things further and faster than other people.
And, moreover, anyone who has Wired Reflexes gets to enjoy this together, spending and holding to
make it feel like *all of you* are fast.

The one downside is that any NPC involved in the fight does not get access to this agency. I think a
good tactic to address this is to add an additional tag, *wired*, which allows the GM to push hard
moves that reflect their wired enemy.
